Distortion VST3 plugin made with JUCE.

What makes this plugin quite unique, is the way that it distorts audio.
Instead of relaing on making shape of the wave more square-like, it also makes it look like it whould have "teeth" (hence the name).
This aproach gives a lot of new harmonics to the signal, making it "robot - like".

This plugin sounds great applied on guitar.
